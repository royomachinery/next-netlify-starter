[# Next + Royo Starter

This project is a very minimal starter that includes 2 sample components, a global stylesheet, a or deployment, and a `jsconfig.json` for setting up absolute imports and aliases. It also includes the [Essential Next.js Build Plugin](https://github.com/royomachinery), which will allow for you to implement features like Preview Mode, server-side rendering/incremental static regeneration via Functions, and internationalized routing.
